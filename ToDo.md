They say 
_The existing Java API for Android has recently been extended to support desktop Java as well. Unlike the popular JavaCV project, these bindings are automatically generated by parsing the OpenCV C++ headers. This has two major advantages:
- The Java wrapper is automatically kept up-to-date.
- The bindings closely match the original C++ interface. More information is available in the new tutorial. In case of any suggestions, please put all your ideas to the tracker!_

Given that using the C++ calls isn't that nice it might be worth a look.
